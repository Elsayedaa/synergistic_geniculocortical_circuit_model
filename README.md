## Synergistic Geniculocortical Circuit Model (SGCC)

The purpose of this project is to create a simple computational model of the geniculocortical pathway in the mouse visual system to understand and characterize the circuit motifs that enable the efficient spatial frequency (SF) codes described in Elsayed (2025). The following are questions addressed by the model:

1) What are the functional properties of dLGN units that preferentially connect to distinct V1 units?
2) What are the inhibitory dynamics driving each distinct V1 unit?
3) What happens to SF decorrelation if coarse-to-fine processing and/or inhibition are turned off in the system?
